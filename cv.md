## About Me
My path in programming began with the fact that I decided to go to university majoring in IT-systems and technologies. During my studies, I spent a long time looking for exactly the IT direction that I would like to do with pleasure every day. After years of searching and trying, I realized that the very direction is frontend development. I really like the field of programming in general, so in the future I plan to link my life with development, in particular with the development of the client side of websites.
